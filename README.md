# statistics-R
A statistic analysis with R.
The main function of this project would include parameter estimation and statistic inference, which may be considered as a realization of statistic software (like Stata) with R.

Since no robust optimization method in Python to do MLE, I switch to R to do MLE.

This repository was divided into 3 repositories, and would not be updated. Just keep it for reference.
